## Set up

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
```


Read in data file with the locations of several game camera locations.

```{r}
cams <- read.csv(here("Data", "site_locations.csv"))
```

```{r}
species <- read.csv(here("Data", "species_per_site.csv"))
```


make df into wide format:

```{r}
sp_wide <- species |> pivot_wider(names_from = Date, 
                                  values_from = Num_species)
```


make something wide and make it long:

```{r}
sp_long <- sp_wide |> pivot_longer(cols = c(`1-Jul-24`:`15-Jul-24`), names_to = "Data", values_to = "Num_species")
```


Join Dataframes

use `join` function to do it.

```{r}
cams_species <- full_join(species, cams)
```

Other direction:

```{r}
site_species <- full_join(cams, species)
```
