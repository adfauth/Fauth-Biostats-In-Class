## Set up
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

Read in tomato data frame:

```{r}
tomatoes = read.csv(here("Data", "tomato_data.csv"))
```

Assign correct data types:
```{r}
head(tomatoes)
```

Make Treatment to a factor
```{r}
tomatoes$Treatment = as.factor(tomatoes$Treatment)
levels(tomatoes$Treatment)
```

Data validation was not used on data entry -- must standardize the names of both groups:

%in% -- "included in"
== -- "exactly equal to" * more efficient in this case but we already did it using previous method
```{r}
fix1 = which(tomatoes$Treatment %in% c("control", "Control"))
# or bc we have one mistake in each: which(data == )
tomatoes$Treatment[fix1] = "control"
head(tomatoes)
```

```{r}
fix2 = which(tomatoes$Treatment %in% c("fertilizer", "Fertilizer"))
tomatoes$Treatment[fix2] = "fertilizer"
levels(tomatoes$Treatment)
```

Re-factor the data:
```{r}
tomatoes$Treatment = factor(tomatoes$Treatment)
levels(tomatoes$Treatment)
```
